      "Bomb the steepest pike you know, or take it easy and cruise the beach drive while eating a cone of ice cream with the Drop Cruiser Photo Collection 2020 38 inch double drop longboard complete from Arbor. This drop down complete keeps you close to the ground making you feel and enjoy those buttery turns more thanks to a lower center of gravity while the cut out, milled wheel wells allow you to really carve out those luscious turns. With the Arbor 69mm 78a soft wheels youll be able to tank through small road obstacles and the abec 5 bearings keep those wheels spinning for less foot pumping, creating a smooth ride overall. Complete with a featured photo taken by Cole Beal of a surfer getting pitted and a classy car photo in the center, this is a truly prolific longboard that is a great choice for cruisers of any skill level.",
