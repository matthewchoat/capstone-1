<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*I need to create an inventory/online storefront that includes products and a shopping pack.
*I'm going to need to learn several new React concepts to acccomplish this and possibly more if I want to go above and beyond.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*I created a wireframe of the products page in the Balsamiq application.
*It includes a navbar with product categories, a shopping pack, and a product gallery with animation.
*I quickly styled the wireframe just to get a general idea/concept of my application.
*I know we haven't covered using APIs yet, but I think it might be an ideal solution for storage. More on that after more research and testing.
*Even though the shopping pack will be a separate page, I plan to use bootstrap modals to open a smaller window for the shopping pack. That way, this will be a true "one page application" for the sake of fluid UX design. I will also utilize "Style Components" to place most of my CSS at the end of each JSX file.
*Going to use Google Fonts and Font Awesome to custom fonts
*Although this will be a one page application. I plan to separate all of my JSX into separate "components" and "actions" folders. I think isolating eachpart of the code is a good plan.
